# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! 
<br /><br />
This was a school project that I've just recently had time to continue to develop and scale up little by little. 
<br /><br />
Right now there are several front-end bugs, that I'm catching as I go, but this is certainly hard to do alone!
<br /><br />
So bug reports, feature requests, other contributions and even genereal suggestions on repo/code/format are more than welcome and encouraged! <br/>

For the most part, the frontend directory can be cloned on its own insofar as there aren't any requests to modify the API schema. On the other hand, I am also currently adding an Open API spec for the backend server.

I'll be adding more instructions here soon in case the detail on running locally isn't sufficient.

Feel free to connect in the meantime.
